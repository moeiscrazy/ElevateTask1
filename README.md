# ElevateTask1

For this task I used the Nmap and Wireshark tools. 

To find the local IP range I opened up cmd as admin and typed in ipconfig /all. This gave me the IPv4 address. I then entered the arp -a command to find the range of addresses on my network. Once I had that I went ahead with using Nmap to scan this ip address range.

During the scan, my AV detected the system being scanned and took protective measures against it. In the scan results I saw 4 open ports for ip address 192.168.1.1

The ports were 53 (default port for DNS), 80 (default network port for web servers using HTTP), 443 (standard port for HTTPS), 5555(used by the Android Debug Bridge).

Port 53, used primarily for DNS (Domain Name System) services, can be exploited in several ways. If a DNS server is exposed to the internet without proper configuration, it may become vulnerable to DNS amplification attacks, where an attacker uses it to flood a target with traffic in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) scenario. It can also be used for data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, where attackers hide stolen data within DNS queries and responses. Insecure DNS configurations can expose the server to cache poisoning or spoofing attacks, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.

Port 80, used for unencrypted HTTP traffic, poses a significant security risk because the data transmitted is not encrypted. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where sensitive information such as login credentials, cookies, or session tokens are intercepted. Web servers running on port 80 may be subject to various vulnerabilities depending on the software used and its configuration. Attackers often scan for outdated web applications to exploit known vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting (XSS). Leaving port 80 open without redirecting to HTTPS also weakens the overall security posture of a site.

Port 443, which handles HTTPS traffic, is generally more secure due to its use of SSL/TLS encryption, but it is not immune to risk. Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS implementations, such as outdated protocols (e.g., SSLv3 or early versions of TLS), weak cipher suites, or improper certificate configurations, can be exploited. Additionally, if the web server software or the web application itself has vulnerabilities, attackers can still gain access through exploits or logic flaws even if the transmission is encrypted. Misconfigurations such as improper access controls or exposed admin panels over HTTPS can further compound the risks.

Port 5555 is not associated with a standard protocol but is commonly used by Android Debug Bridge (ADB) when it is enabled over a network. If ADB is exposed on port 5555, especially without authentication, it becomes a serious security risk. Attackers can gain shell access to the device, allowing them to install malicious applications, access sensitive data, or fully take over the device. Even on non-Android systems, if any service listens on this port and is improperly secured, it can be exploited similarly. This port is often scanned by automated tools looking for vulnerable IoT or Android devices, making it a high-risk vector if exposed.

I ran another scan on the current IPv4 address 192.168.1.17 and ran Wireshark at the same time to capture the packets and analyze them. The scan results showed 4 ports to be open. 135, 139, 445, and 2869. Here's some more details about them and their risks:

Port 135/tcp, associated with MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call), is used by Windows systems for the RPC Endpoint Mapper service. It facilitates DCOM and other RPC-based communications between applications across the network. Although essential for some Windows services, it poses a high security risk, as it has been frequently targeted for remote code execution and lateral movement attacks. For security, this port should not be exposed to the internet and should be tightly controlled within internal networks.

Port 139/tcp, which supports the NetBIOS Session Service, is used for file and printer sharing in older Windows environments, leveraging the NetBIOS protocol over TCP/IP. This port has been largely phased out in modern networks in favor of SMB directly over port 445, but it may still be active in legacy systems. Due to its historical vulnerabilities, this port should be disabled if not in active use and blocked from external access.

Port 445/tcp is used by Microsoft-DS (Directory Services) and is crucial for SMB (Server Message Block) traffic, including file sharing, printer access, and Windows domain controller functions. It is widely used in enterprise networks but is also one of the most exploited ports, particularly in ransomware attacks like WannaCry. Exposing port 445 to the internet is strongly discouraged; instead, access should be restricted to trusted devices, and secure alternatives such as VPNs should be used.

Port 2869/tcp is linked to ICSLAP (Internet Connection Sharing Layer and Application Protocol), a service used by Windows for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) communications. This port allows devices on a local network to discover each other and set up network services automatically. While convenient, UPnP has a long history of security issues, and leaving this port open on untrusted networks can expose devices to remote reconfiguration or unauthorized access. It is best to disable UPnP or at least restrict it to safe, internal segments of the network.
